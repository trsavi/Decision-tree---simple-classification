# Decision-tree---simple-classification
Implementation of decision tree classification without EDA and other visualizations. Included simple tuning of hyperparameters with GridSearch and cross-validation with k-folds. 

Simple as it is, it is good starting point for bigginers with no experiences with implementation of ML algorithms.
